Given the original text, generate three follow-up questions that help deepen understanding of the topic and clarify key concepts. Separate each question with a question mark and a newline. Focus on questions that explore the implications, limitations, or applications of the ideas presented in the text.

[Original Text]: Machine learning transformers work by taking input data, often in the form of sequences like text, and processing it through layers of self-attention mechanisms. This self-attention allows the model to weigh the importance of different parts of the input differently, enabling it to capture complex patterns and relationships within the data. Finally, the transformers output the processed information, which can be used for various tasks such as translation, text generation, or classification, by understanding both the context and the specific details of the input.

[Follow Up Questions]:
1. How do the self-attention mechanisms in transformers enable the model to capture long-range dependencies and contextual information in the input data?
2. What are some limitations or challenges associated with training and deploying large-scale transformer models, and how are researchers addressing these issues?
3. Can you discuss how transformers have been adapted and applied to domains beyond natural language processing, such as computer vision or speech recognition?

******************************
Prompt: You are an expert educator helping me develop a deep understanding and intuition in the field of ${field}. I will provide you with a paper text related to this field. Your task is to carefully read the paper, identify key sections, and use the information to help me ask more insightful questions about the topic.

Here is the paper text:
<paper>
${paperText}
</paper>

After reading the paper, I will ask you a question and provide additional context that I think is relevant to my question. The context will typically be specific sections from the paper.

<question>
MY_QUESTION
</question>

<context>
MY_CONTEXT
</context>

Using the provided context, identify the most relevant sections in the paper that can help address the question. Analyze the information in these sections and consider how it relates to the question.

<thinking>
Step 1: Identify the key concepts and ideas presented in the relevant sections of the paper. Break down complex ideas into smaller, more digestible components to help build a foundation for understanding.

Step 2: Examine the relationships and connections between the key concepts. Look for patterns, similarities, and differences that can help illuminate the underlying principles at work.

Step 3: Consider the implications and potential applications of the ideas presented. Think about how these concepts might be used in real-world scenarios and what impact they could have on the field.

Step 4: Reflect on the limitations and edge cases associated with the concepts discussed. Identify potential challenges or scenarios where the ideas might break down or require further refinement.

Step 5: Synthesize the information and insights gathered from the previous steps to develop a cohesive understanding of the topic. Focus on the key takeaways and how they contribute to building intuition in the field.
</thinking>

Based on your step-by-step analysis, provide suggestions for asking more insightful questions related to the topic. Your suggestions should demonstrate a deep understanding of the field and the specific information in the paper.

<suggestions>
1. [Question 1]: This question should focus on exploring the foundational concepts and their implications, helping to build a strong conceptual understanding of the topic.

2. [Question 2]: This question should delve into the relationships and connections between key ideas, encouraging a more holistic view of the subject matter.

3. [Question 3]: This question should probe the potential applications and real-world impact of the concepts discussed, fostering a practical understanding of the field.

4. [Question 4]: This question should challenge assumptions and explore edge cases or limitations, promoting critical thinking and a more nuanced perspective on the topic.
</suggestions>

Remember, your goal is to guide me in asking better questions that will help me develop a strong intuitive understanding of this field. Use your expertise and the information in the paper to provide valuable insights and thought-provoking questions that build upon each other, leading to a deeper, more intuitive grasp of the subject matter.
